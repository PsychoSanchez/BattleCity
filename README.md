This is a ~10+ years old C++ game project, that initially was a second year university work, as of now rewritten with C++ 23 modules. 

Project was meant to introduce to:
- Object oriented programming with C++
- Work with grid based 2D games
- Processing of `WinApi` events
- Rendering and keyboard hooking using `gdiplus`

Now it also allows to look into
- C++ modules
